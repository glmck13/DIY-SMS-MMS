# Background
At first I only set out to build a simple browser-based client to send/receive SMS and MMS messages using [Flowroute‚Äôs messaging API](https://developer.flowroute.com/api/messages/v2.2/).  Then I ran into the brick wall known as A2P (Application-to-Person) 10DLC registration.  Essentially in order to use the messaging APIs for any of the VoIP service providers, you must first register your ‚ÄúBrand‚Äù and ‚ÄúCampaign‚Äù with them, and they in turn register these with [‚ÄúThe Campaign Registry‚Äù](https://www.campaignregistry.com/).  If you‚Äôre a simple user like me who only wants to send P2P (Person-to-Person) messages, you‚Äôll soon find yourself shut out of the messaging platforms altogether.  Flowroute would not even accept my 10DLC application, even though I obtained an EIN from the IRS precisely so I would qualify as a business.  Since the entire process is controlled by the Mobile Network Operators ‚Äì and is not government regulated ‚Äì it‚Äôs impossible to seek any remedy if you get denied.  And I thought less government regulation was supposed to be a good thing! üòä

# Architecture
So I set out to send/receive text messages through the cellular network directly.  I went searching for some free/open-source Linux software that could perform messaging through a USB cellular modem.  Most of the work in this area has been done to support development of the [PinePhone](https://pine64.org/devices/pinephone/), a mobile phone with Debian Linux at its core.  The key components are [ModemManager](https://modemmanager.org/) and [mmsd-tng](https://gitlab.com/kop316/mmsd).  There‚Äôs also an SMS/MMS messaging client available for the GNOME desktop called [Chatty](https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Chatty), but I decided to hack together my own client since I wanted API access to the messaging interface that Chatty didn‚Äôt offer.  Thankfully I found [SXMO](https://sxmo.org/), which showed me how to interact with the modem stack using mmcli, mmsctl and D-Bus.  The version of SXMO posted here is a greatly stripped down version of what‚Äôs available on the official repo, and includes a simple Python HTTP server to support API calls and file retrieval.

# USB modem and cellular plan
My solution uses a [Quectel EC25-AF(D)](https://www.quectel.com/product/lte-ec25-series/) modem, since that‚Äôs the technology used in the PinePhone.  Before purchasing a modem (I got [this one]( https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256803392917668.html?gatewayAdapt=glo2usa) from AliExpress for $50) I confirmed the device is supported by the U.S. mobile operators:

+ [AT&T approved devices](https://iotdevices.att.com/certified-devices.aspx)
+ [Verizon approved devices](https://opendevelopment.verizonwireless.com/design-and-build/approved-modules)
+ [T-Mobile approved devices](https://wholesale.t-mobile.com/iot/modules-chipsets-devices/)

As regards a mobile data plan, I went with Red Pocket since they [offer service on all three carriers](https://www.redpocket.com/coverage).  The APN settings needed to set up Modem Manager and mmsd-tng are [documented here](https://help.redpocket.com/setup-your-activated-gsma-sim-card) 

# Ubuntu installation
I‚Äôm running the latest LTS release of Ubuntu (24.04/noble), with the following additional packages:
```
apt install ksh jq pnc
```
Instructions for configuring the modem can be found on Ubuntu‚Äôs [How-to page]( https://ubuntu.com/core/docs/networkmanager/configure-cellular-connections).  Note that the standard Ubuntu/Debian release already includes ModemManager, so there‚Äôs no need to install the snap (in fact, it‚Äôs better to use the .deb package vs. the snap since you‚Äôll run into some D-Bus permission issues if you install the snap).  As I recall mmsd-tng also comes included in the standard distribution, but if that‚Äôs not the case, you can simply apt install it as root (again, install the package, not the snap). If things aren't working, just try Google-ing your problem.  There's lot's of material out there on Debian's cellular modem stack.  Here's a [good reference](https://junyelee.blogspot.com/2021/03/linux-mobile-interface-broadband-model.html) to read over as well.
```
nmcli c add type gsm ifname '*' con-name RedPocket apn ERESELLER
```

ModemManager will by default assign a higher route metric on the wwan interface so this connection doesn't function as your default route to the Internet.  This is preferred so as not to burn through all of the data in your mobile data plan.  MobileManager will also enbale IPv6 on the wwan link.  **Be sure to check**, however, that IPv6 is enabled on your primary route.  If not, the kernel will route traffic to any IPv6 sites through your mobile interface, regardless of the metric value.  

When configuring mmsd-tng, follow the instructions posted under "General Configuration" and "Configuring the Modem Manager Plugin" on Chris Talbot's site.  You'll find the appropriate APN, MMSC, and proxy settings on [Red Pocket's SIM activation page](https://help.redpocket.com/setup-your-activated-gsma-sim-card).

The sxmo utilities as well as mmsd-tng run as an ordinary user (not root), so they make use of the D-Bus ‚Äúsession‚Äù bus.  ModemManager, on the other hand, runs as root and resides on the D-Bus ‚Äúsystem‚Äù bus.  In order for sxmo to talk to ModemManager, I did as follows (I‚Äôm sure there are more proper ways for granting privilege, but this was an easy hack!).  Execute these commands as root:
```
chmod u+s /usr/bin/mmcli

cat - >/etc/dbus-1/system-local.conf  <<EOF
<!DOCTYPE busconfig PUBLIC
"-//freedesktop//DTD D-Bus Bus Configuration 1.0//EN"
"http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/dbus/1.0/busconfig.dtd">
<busconfig>
    <policy user="*">
        <allow eavesdrop="true" send_destination="*"/>
    </policy>
</busconfig>
EOF
```

# sxmo tools
As I mentioned above, these tools run as an ordinary user.  In my case, I have a user ‚Äúgerry‚Äù which is configured to autologin at boot time.  The sxmo files are installed under ~/opt/sxmo.  Be sure to set execute permission on the files after copying them. 

The easiest way I found to launch the sxmo.sh script is to configure it as a Startup Application.  Just click on ‚ÄúStartup Applications‚Äù from your Ubuntu desktop, and add an entry for sxmo.sh.  

There are two environment variables you need to configure within sxmo.sh for your particular installation:
+ **SXMO_MYHTTP** This is the base URL for the Python web server on your Ubuntu host, e.g. http://ubuntu.lan:8000.  The Python server implements an API modeled after Flowroute's implementation, as well as a file retrieval mechanism which the software on the Raspberry Pi uses to send/receive messages. The Python server uses ordinary HTTP not HTTPS, since all communication with the sxmo environment will take place inside your internal LAN.  Technically the software on the Raspberry Pi (Apache & accompanying CGI scripts) can be hosted on the Ubuntu server, but I decided to separate these since I already had a Pi running FreePBX & Asterisk to support voice calls over my VoIP line (take a look at: [PBX-My-Home](https://github.com/glmck13/PBX-My-Home) ).  In addition, my Raspberry Pi is firewalled off and Internet-accessible, and I did not want to do the same for my Ubuntu host.

+ **SXMO_WEBHOOK** This is the URL of the CGI function on the Raspberry Pi which the sxmo software invokes whenever it receives an SMS/MMS from the modem stack, e.g. https://pbxmyhome.lan/$SXMO_MYNUM/rcvmms.cgi  

# Raspberry Pi installation
The app can be installed on any host running an Apache web server with https configured, since the Flowroute API sends/receives messages using HTTPS.  You can install the app on the PBX server if you'd like, but if so, you'll first have to register a domain name for your site, and obtain an SSL certificate.  There are a variety of ways to accomplish this, but you'll likely have to shell out a few dollars to register a domain name.  Many domain providers also give you the option to purchase a certificate for an additional fee, or you can get a cert for free using [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) and their [Cerbot utility](https://certbot.eff.org/).

Once your site is https-enabled, the rest of the installation is pretty simple. The instuctions below assume you're installing the app on your PBX server.  Execute these as root:
+ Install the following additional packages:
```
apt install ksh uuid-runtime gridsite-clients
```
+ Enable CGI processing on your Apache server:
```
a2enmod cgid
sed -i -e "s/^#\([[:space:]]*AddHandler[[:space:]]*cgi-script[[:space:]]*\.cgi\)$/\1/" /etc/apache2/mods-available/mime.conf
sed -i -e "s/^\([[:space:]]*Options Indexes FollowSymLinks\)$/\1 ExecCGI/" /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
```
+ Prevent FreePBX from disabling execute permissions on the app:
```
cat - <<EOF >/etc/asterisk/freepbx_chown.conf
[blacklist]
directory = /var/www/html/cgi
directory = /var/www/html/msgapp
```
+ Grant Flowroute's SMS/MMS messaging server access to your PBX by adding the following statement to your /etc/iptables/rules.v4 file anywhere before the final COMMIT:
```
-A INPUT -s 52.88.246.140 -j ACCEPT
```
+ Install the "msgapp" directory and its contents located in this repository directly under /var/www/html on your server. then execute:
```
chmod +x *.cgi *sh *.py
mv htaccess .htaccess
```
+ Edit the two getenv files and populate your Flowroute credentials as well as the msgapp URL for your site.  Set the A2P variable to whatever name you want to associate with your DID within A2P authorization messages.

+ Login to your Flowroute account, select your DID, then:
  + Choose a DID Action &rarr; Enable Messaging, Apply Action
  + Choose a DID Action &rarr; Set Callback URL, Apply Action.  On the next screen enter the https URL for your mspapp in the "Callback URL" box, check all of the SM, MMS, and DLR boxes, and then click Set Callback URL.

That's it!
